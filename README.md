# NewDayAlarm
Alarm app built with Flutter

New Day Alarm is an alarm app that plays a new song each morning from a playlist of curated songs to help you wake up with a smile on your face. It's still in the early alpha stages of development and doesn't even have to code to function as a NORMAL alarm app but it does have the back-end data handling, and a bit of the UI in place. Ultimately, I hope to be able to monetize this app by presenting it to specific artists as a way to boost their visibility by having their song played to, potentially, hundreds of thousands of people waking up in the morning.

Another thing I've realized is that I don't currently have a reliable way to access any good music because I'm not up for requesting tons of music licenses every time I want to add songs to the queue. I have a decent playlist on spotify but using that or just Spotify's API in general would require that the users have Spotify Premium and I would prefer to have the app open to more that just that demographic. If you have any ideas for solutions to this, hit me up!
